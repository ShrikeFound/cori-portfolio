            <p>
              <strong>I believe</strong> in creating an equitable classroom
              environment to the best of my abilities because students must feel
              welcomed, safe, and respected in the classroom before they can
              accomplish any learning.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>I believe</strong> in teaching depth before breadth.
              Biology is an incredibly far reaching area of study, but there are
              several foundational topics from which students can build
              understanding of almost everything else. I believe in teaching
              these foundational topics well, and so that every student
              understands them, rather than try to teach every unit in Biology.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>I believe</strong> in self-reflection as a major theme of
              my instruction and also as a habit of mind. Education is a
              constantly shifting practice, and so must I constantly evaluate
              myself in order to be sure I’m providing students with the best
              possible teaching.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>I believe</strong> that every student’s behavior, and in
              reality every person’s behavior, is seeking to fulfill a purpose.
              If a student is acting in a manner not conducive to learning, it
              is my job to learn the function of that behavior and to teach
              better strategies for that student to accomplish that need. This
              type of learning, called social-emotional learning, helps students
              learn how to manage their emotions in ways that prevent future
              issues rather than ostracize the student further.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>I believe</strong> that every student is capable of
              learning the material presented in my class. It is my job to make
              sure that my content is accessible to all students by learning
              about them, their cultures, their personalities, and their
              interests in order to make the content more relevant to their
              lives. It is often when students do not understand the
              <em>why</em> behind their learning that they disengage.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>I believe</strong> in empowering students to understand
              their role in a larger scientific society and the role that
              science plays in their lives. Students should be able to decipher
              and critically evaluate the information they take in from media
              for credibility.
